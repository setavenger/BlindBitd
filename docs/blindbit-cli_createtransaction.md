## blindbit-cli createtransaction

Construct a transaction

### Synopsis

This command can be used to create a transaction sending to several addresses if needed.
By default this will output the raw transaction hex.
Setting the `--broadcast` flag will automatically broadcast the transaction.
Then the command will output the txid of the created transaction.
UTXOs used in a transaction are automatically marked as spent_unconfirmed.
Use --notmarkspent to not do this.
Use --usespent to include spent_unconfirmed UTXOs in transaction creation.

```
