# blindbitd (wip)

Receive and send functionality. This is the daemon for the BlindBit Wallet. The daemon can be controlled
with [blindbit-cli](./cli/README.md). Still in early testing, only use with funds you can
afford to lose. When started and unlocked the daemon will run continuously in the background using minimal resources
while not processing. When actively scanning a block more resources will be needed. The daemon periodically checks for
new blocks and also listens to Electrum's `blockchain.headers.subscribe`.

IMPORTANT: The wallet data and keys are only encrypted when on disk. For scanning purposes the private keys are
currently always kept in memory. In future there will be a separate spending password that encrypts the spend secret key
and the mnemonic separately.

IMPORTANT: Currently there is no good way to check for spent UTXOs. blindbitd checks an electrum server for a
scriptPubKeys balance. Using public electrum servers will leak privacy! Per default Tor is enabled for requests to the
electrum server. It can be disabled in cases were one trusts the electrum server.

IMPORTANT: As this is still work in progress breaking changes can and probably will happen at any time.

IMPORTANT: A light client should not try to make transactions from several instances in parallel. This will almost 
definitely resolve in failing transactions. For now it is recommended to only have one instance running per wallet/seed.

## Setup

### Requirements

- go 1.21.9 installed
- access to an electrum server
- access to a blindbit style indexing server like [BlindBit Oracle](https://github.com/setavenger/blindbit-oracle)
    - I'm hosting a signet BlindBit-Oracle server here: signet.blindbit.snblago.com:8000
- access to an electrum server
    - I'm hosting a signet Electrum server here: signet.electrum.snblago.com:50001

### Build

There is a makefile from which you can easily build the daemon and the accompanying cli.
The resulting binaries will end up in the project root in a directory called `bin`.
Build both with:

```console
$ make build
```

Build only blindbitd with:

```console
$ make build-daemon
```

Build only blindbit-cli with:

```console
$ make build-cli
```

### Run

The daemon requires a config toml file `blindbit.toml` to be present in its datadir. The socket to the daemon is created
in `<datadir/run/blindbit.socket>`. The path to the socket has to be passed to `blindbit-cli` in order to access the
daemon. The default path for blindbitd is `~/.blindbitd`. For both programs the default path for the socket is set
to `~/.blindbitd/run/blindbit.socket`.

You can then run with:

```console
$ bin/blindbitd
```

```console
$ bin/blindbitd-cli status
```

## Controlling the daemon

Currently, the daemon is only exposed via a unix socket. The [blindbit-cli](./cli/README.md) controls the flow of the
daemon. On initial startup you can use `createwallet` command to either initialise a new wallet or recover from a
mnemonic with `recoverwallet`. `listaddresses` shows your address. You can use `createtransaction` to send to an
address. If the wallet was already set up you can use `unlock`.


## Scan-Only mode

The daemon can also be run in scan only mode. Only the spend pubkey and the scan secret key will be stored by the dameon. The spend secret key will be unknown to the daemon making spending utxos impossible. Setting `scan_only = 1` under `[wallet]` will start the daemon in scan only mode.
If the daemon ran in normal mode before it is not recommended to just switch to scan only mode as the spend secret key will still be present. Deleting the `data/keys` file in daemons data directory will resolve this issue. 

Once the daemon is waiting for setup, call `setupscanonly`. Add the spend public key via the flag and you will be prompted to input the scan secret key. You can add a `birthheight` to avoid unnecessary scanning. If you are using labels you must add `--labelcount` and provide the number of labels you have created. Otherwise your transactions involving labels will not be detected as expected.

## Todo

### Priority 1

- [ ] Bring test coverage to a meaningful level
- [x] Create a coin selector that incorporates the fees
- [x] Binary encoding to reduce bandwidth save time on decoding (protoBuffs)
- [ ] Add Transaction History
- [x] Mark UTXOs as spent (or similar) if used for a transaction
- [x] Change naming convention of log files
    - It should be easy to determine such that a user does not always have to check the current name

### Priority 2

- [ ] Be able to set Log level
- [ ] More tests for coin selector
    - Selector seems very accurate, but should rather do +1sat to exceed fee and don't go below
- [ ] Coin selector allow float fees
- [ ] UTXO export - similar to a backup to avoid rescanning from birthHeight
- [ ] Separate spending password
- [ ] Out-of-band notifications
    - share tweak and tx data directly with the receiver to reduce scanning efforts (follow blindbit standard set for
      the mobile app)
- [ ] Balance checks for UTXOs: account for more than one UTXO per script
- [ ] Expand logging especially on errors
- [ ] Check which panics to keep
- [ ] Automatically make annotation in tx-history if sent to sp-address, not possible to reconstruct in hindsight
- [ ] Don't always add change in coin selector (see todo)
- [ ] Load UTXOs from txid
    - input: a txid supplied by the sender
    - output: success/error
    - flow: The user receives a txid from the sender. The daemon sources the tx (origin not clear yet) and checks
      whether an utxo belongs to the wallet.
    - note: This would be in addition to out-of-band notifications. In case some wallets don't create out-of-band
      notifications. A txid can always be shared.

## IPC

- [x] Create New label
    - Give comment
    - Returns label address
- [x] Create Tx and broadcast
- [x] Broadcast raw Tx
- [ ] Pause/Resume scanning
- [x] List UTXOs by label

## Roadmap

- [ ] Conceptualise a way how to potentially run the daemon in an Umbrel like setup.
    - Would enable non-power users to have easy access to Silent Payments
    - Run in a scan-only mode; spend secret key and mnemonic are never shared with the daemon
    - Spending could occur through a separate channel
